I have been given the task in Assessment.txt which involves finally generating a report via LLM about my approach to solving the given problem of creating knowledge graphs from unstructured text. I will provide you with my process and detail what each document covers, and your task is to generate the report as detailed in Assessment.txt.


First, I researched on my own about knowledge graphs online for about 30 mins. This is where I became aware of LangChain capabilities. I have prior experience with using Gemini API.


Then, to bolster my knowledge and brainstorm approaches, I used Perplexity, of which the chat details can be found in Perplexity Chat.md. Perplexity gave me three possible approaches. The first one was manual generation and entry, which is not what the problem statement wants, so that was discarded. The second was using LangChain which was the approach I was already leaning towards from the beginning, but I wanted to see if there were better ways to do it. The final way was to train my own LLM which would take more time than the allowed 8 hours. Hence, I stuck with my initial plan of using LangChain with Gemini.


Next, I used Copilot (Claude Sonnet 3.7 Thinking) for implementation. The chat details can be found in Copilot Chat.txt. The code had some issues that I fixed manually, e.g. no attribute 'verbose' and 'triples'. Then I tested out the code and got the knowledge graph html, but I found it hard to read as all the nodes were clumped together and would spring back after I dragged them away from each other. I consulted Copilot about this and got a suggested fix that did not work, so I Googled and fixed it myself by disabling the physics for the visualization. Originally I simply used a fixed sample text to test, but once that worked, I changed to allowing reading in of a text file which is more user-friendly. I tested that out by extracting and downloading a txt of the Wikipedia article for Albert Einstein. The final notebook is found in KnowledgeGraph_with_Personality_V2.ipynb.


The use of short chats across multiple LLMs was intentional as 1) I realized over time with LLM use that performance often deteriorates as the conversation grows in length, and 2) Different LLMs have their own strengths, e.g. Perplexity for research because it always leverages the internet instead of pure text generation, and I can clearly cross check sources; Copilot for coding because that is what it is designed for and it generally gives more bug-free code; ChatGPT for report generation because GPT excels more at writing and digesting large amounts of text at once.


Please generate the report.

## Response:
Here is the final report, generated according to the Assessment.txt brief and based on your provided materials — Perplexity Chat.md, Copilot Chat.txt, KnowledgeGraph_with_Personality_V2.ipynb, and knowledge_graph.html.



Report: Knowledge Graph Construction with Personality Modeling


1. Introduction


This report outlines my approach to solving the open-ended problem of creating a knowledge graph (KG) with personality modeling from unstructured text, using LLMs as both a research and development partner. The task required not only implementing a working pipeline but also demonstrating critical reasoning in selecting methods, tools, and design trade-offs. The final implementation leverages LangChain with Google Gemini as the LLM backend, building a modular, extensible pipeline for automated KG generation, enrichment, and visualization.



2. Research Process


2.1 Independent Background Review


Before engaging any LLM, I spent about 30 minutes reviewing online materials to refresh my understanding of knowledge graphs and assess feasible implementation pathways. This initial exploration revealed that LangChain provides an abstraction layer for LLM-based graph construction (e.g., LLMGraphTransformer and GraphCypherQAChain). I also noted that my prior experience with the Gemini API could be directly applied through langchain-google-genai.


2.2 Brainstorming with Perplexity


I used Perplexity AI to systematically identify solution approaches (full conversation in Perplexity Chat.md). Perplexity generated three possible strategies:


Manual Knowledge Graph Construction — human-curated nodes and edges.
→ Discarded as it did not meet the problem’s requirement for automation.

LangChain-based Automated Extraction — using Gemini as the LLM to extract triples (subject, relation, object) and construct graphs programmatically.
→ Selected approach.

Training a Custom LLM for entity and relationship extraction.
→ Rejected due to the 8-hour project constraint.


Perplexity’s analysis aligned with my prior intuition, validating that a LangChain–Gemini stack offered the best balance of feasibility, scalability, and code modularity. It also provided conceptual clarity on the use of LLMGraphTransformer, Big Five personality traits modeling, and visualization via PyVis or Neo4j.



3. Implementation Development


3.1 Code Generation with Copilot (Claude Sonnet 3.7 Thinking)


Implementation was developed interactively with Claude (Copilot) (see Copilot Chat.txt). The iterative workflow followed a structured pipeline, progressively refined through short prompt–response exchanges to maintain LLM accuracy. Copilot was selected for code generation due to its strong reliability in producing syntactically correct Python notebooks.


Initial Version


The initial notebook, KnowledgeGraph_with_Personality.ipynb, was scaffolded with the following modules:


Environment Setup — installation of dependencies (langchain, langchain-google-genai, networkx, pyvis, etc.) and initialization of Gemini via LangChain.

Text Preprocessing — using RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter to chunk text for token-efficient processing.

Graph Extraction — employing LLMGraphTransformer to obtain triples.

Graph Construction — building a directed graph in NetworkX.

Personality Modeling — extracting Big Five traits for person entities via Gemini prompts and adding them as weighted edges.

Visualization — rendering an interactive graph using PyVis.

Querying — enabling natural language queries via Gemini (query_graph_llm).


Key Modifications


Through testing and debugging, several critical refinements were made:


Bug Fixes:
Removed deprecated .verbose and .triples attributes.

Usability Enhancements:
Modified visualization to disable physics ("enabled": false) for readability and manual repositioning.

Replaced trait edge labels (has_openness, etc.) with numerical scores for clarity.

Dynamic File Support:
Allowed loading of arbitrary text files instead of static sample text.

Automatically generated output filenames ({textfilename}_graph.html) for easier reusability.

Enhanced Query Context:
Revised query prompts to expose trait values directly to Gemini, ensuring personality-based comparisons could be reasoned about quantitatively (e.g., “Who is most extroverted?”).


These refinements were applied across the modified functions in Copilot Chat.txt, namely:


visualize_graph()

add_personality_to_graph()

build_knowledge_graph_with_personality()

query_graph_llm()



4. Output and Results


4.1 Generated Graph


The final graph output (knowledge_graph.html) visualizes entity–relationship structures and personality connections for the input text — a synthetic passage describing employees at a company (“TechInnovate”)


knowledge_graph


.


Red nodes: People (with personality data)

Blue nodes: Organizations or locations

Green nodes: Big Five personality traits


Edges between people and traits are labeled with numeric scores (0–1), and their thickness corresponds to magnitude. For instance, Michael Brown → Extraversion (0.90) visually indicates a strong trait expression.


4.2 Personality Modeling


Each person’s node tooltip includes:


Trait scores for Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism

Key descriptors (e.g., “creative, organized, patient”)


This allows both human interpretation and LLM reasoning over structured trait data.


4.3 Visualization Example


When opened, the graph displays nodes with free dragging enabled and stable layout (no snapping back), addressing the usability issue discovered during testing.



5. Justification of Design Choices

Design Decision
Rationale
LangChain + Gemini
Combines structured graph transformation utilities with Gemini’s strong semantic reasoning.
NetworkX + PyVis
Lightweight, visual, and easily exportable without database setup (e.g., Neo4j).
Big Five (OCEAN) Framework
Universally recognized and quantifiable personality representation model.
Edge Weights as Scores
Numeric labels and thickness convey trait magnitude visually and semantically.
Short Multi-LLM Workflow
Prevents context drift and leverages model specialization (Perplexity for research, Copilot for coding, GPT for reporting).


6. Insights and Reflections


LLM Synergy: The multi-agent workflow demonstrated clear advantages. Perplexity’s live web grounding ensured accuracy in concept formation, Copilot’s structured code generation minimized syntax errors, and GPT’s summarization was ideal for producing this report.

Prompt Design: Chained prompting was critical. Separate prompts for entity extraction, personality modeling, and visualization prevented conflation of tasks.

Interpretability: Explicitly embedding numeric personality values in the graph and in LLM prompts significantly improved interpretability and query quality.

Limitations:
Personality extraction accuracy depends on Gemini’s interpretive consistency; results may vary across runs.

The visualization layout can still become cluttered for large texts.

Evaluation metrics (precision/recall for triples) were not implemented due to limited ground truth.



7. Future Enhancements


Schema Normalization: Introduce named entity resolution (NER) or Wikidata alignment.

GraphRAG Integration: Combine KG with vector retrieval for hybrid question answering.

Quantitative Evaluation: Measure entity-relationship extraction accuracy using benchmark datasets.

Domain Adaptation: Train domain-specific personality extraction prompts for greater reliability.



8. Conclusion


This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end pipeline for constructing and enriching knowledge graphs from unstructured text using LangChain and Gemini. The approach integrates natural-language understanding, personality modeling, and interactive visualization within a modular architecture.


The workflow satisfies the assessment’s requirements by:


Conducting independent LLM-assisted research (Perplexity).

Developing a working LangChain–Gemini implementation (Copilot).

Providing a structured report generated by an LLM (GPT).


The final solution not only achieves automated knowledge graph creation but also illustrates how reasoning-capable LLMs can be systematically orchestrated across research, development, and reporting phases to produce coherent, explainable outputs.

Trait edges are labeled with numeric scores (0–1) and rendered with proportional thickness.



⚠️ Limitations


Gemini API Rate Limits:
The free-tier quota (even for Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite) restricts the volume of text processed per minute.
Therefore, the full Einstein Wikipedia article could not be parsed in one pass; only a representative extract was used.

Trait Consistency:
Personality estimates depend on prompt interpretation and may vary slightly across runs.

Graph Clutter:
Large texts can produce dense node clusters, requiring manual zooming for readability.



🧭 Future Work


Integrate Neo4j or Memgraph for persistent graph storage.

Add NER-based normalization to merge duplicate entities.

Extend to GraphRAG for semantic question answering over the graph.

Implement evaluation metrics (precision/recall) for extracted triples.
