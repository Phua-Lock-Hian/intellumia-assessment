User: You are an expert in knowledge graphs. Develop a Python solution that takes a text document, extract and build a knowledge graph (KG) from the document. The graph will represent the knowledge from the document in a structured way. Furthermore, the personality of the subjects from the text should also be modelled in the graph. The end product can just be a Jupyter notebook. Make use of LangChain, specifically using Gemini LLM in the code. I already have a sample workflow sketched out in the attached PDF file, make use of it if it is helpful.

Copilot: # Knowledge Graph Construction from Text with Personality Modeling

I'll create a comprehensive Jupyter notebook solution that builds a knowledge graph from text documents and models personality traits using LangChain with Google's Gemini API. Let me outline the complete implementation based on the LangChain approach you mentioned.

## Jupyter Notebook Implementation

Here's a detailed Jupyter notebook that implements the knowledge graph extraction and personality modeling workflow:

## Implementation Details

The notebook I've created implements the complete LangChain-based approach for building a knowledge graph with personality modeling. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

1. **Environment Setup**
   - Installs necessary packages: langchain, langchain-google-genai, langchain-experimental, neo4j, networkx, pyvis, etc.
   - Sets up the Gemini model via LangChain's ChatGoogleGenerativeAI interface

2. **Document Preprocessing**
   - Functions for loading, cleaning, and chunking text documents
   - Uses RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter to break down large texts into manageable chunks

3. **Knowledge Graph Construction**
   - Implements LLMGraphTransformer to extract triples (subject, predicate, object) from text
   - Builds a NetworkX graph from the extracted triples

4. **Personality Modeling**
   - Identifies person entities within the graph
   - Extracts Big Five personality traits (OCEAN model) for each person using Gemini
   - Adds personality traits and descriptors as node attributes
   - Creates trait nodes and weighted relationships to represent personality traits

5. **Graph Visualization**
   - Visualizes the knowledge graph using PyVis
   - Color-codes nodes (red for persons, green for traits, blue for other entities)
   - Displays personality information in node tooltips
   - Uses weighted edges to represent personality trait strengths

6. **Graph Querying**
   - Provides natural language querying capabilities using Gemini
   - Implements specific functions to find entities by personality trait

7. **Complete Pipeline**
   - Combines all components into a single workflow
   - Takes text input and produces a fully annotated knowledge graph with personality insights

8. **Example Usage**
   - Demonstrates the workflow with a sample text about a company and its employees
   - Shows how to query the graph for relationship and personality insights

## Key Features

- **Automated triple extraction** using Gemini's capabilities through LangChain
- **Personality trait modeling** using the Big Five (OCEAN) framework
- **Interactive visualization** with node attributes and weighted relationships
- **Natural language querying** of the knowledge graph structure
- **Modular design** that can be extended or modified for specific use cases

The notebook follows the workflow you provided, implementing all the key components from environment setup to graph querying and visualization, with special attention to personality modeling as requested.

User: Can you modify the graph such that I can click and drag to reposition the nodes instead of having them snap back to position once the mouse is released? Also, instead of has_[personality trait] as the label for the arrows, it would be better to have the score for that trait (the number between 0 to 1) as the arrow label. Please show the changes needed for the necessary functions only (do not regenerate the whole notebook)

Copilot: # Modifications for Graph Visualization

Here are the changes needed to allow node repositioning and update arrow labels to show trait scores:

```python name=modified_visualize_function.py
def visualize_graph(graph, output_file="knowledge_graph.html"):
    """Visualize graph using PyVis"""
    # Create PyVis network
    net = Network(notebook=True, width="100%", height="800px", directed=True)

        # Prepare node attributes for visualization
        title = f"<b>{node}</b><br>"
        
        # Add personality traits to title if available
        personality_traits = ["openness", "conscientiousness", "extraversion", "agreeableness", "neuroticism"]
        for trait in personality_traits:
            if trait in attrs:
                title += f"{trait.capitalize()}: {attrs[trait]:.2f}<br>"
        
        if "descriptors" in attrs:

        # Choose node color based on entity type
        if is_person:
            color = "#ff6666"  # Red for persons
        elif any(trait == node for trait in [t.capitalize() for t in personality_traits]):
            color = "#66ff66"  # Green for traits
        else:
            color = "#6666ff"  # Blue for other entities
        
        # Add node to network
        net.add_node(node, label=attrs.get("label", node), title=title, color=color)
    
    # Add edges with labels
    for source, target, attrs in graph.edges(data=True):
        edge_label = attrs.get("label", "")
        edge_weight = attrs.get("weight", 1)
        
        # Use the trait score as label instead of "has_trait"
        if edge_label.startswith("has_"):
            # Use the weight (score) as the label
            edge_label = f"{edge_weight:.2f}"
        
        # Make personality trait edges thicker based on their value
        width = 1
        if attrs.get("label", "").startswith("has_"):
            width = edge_weight * 5  # Scale up for visibility
        
        net.add_edge(source, target, label=edge_label, width=width)
    
    # Configure physics to allow nodes to be dragged and stay in place
    net.set_options("""

    # Save and display
    net.save_graph(output_file)
    return display(HTML(f"<a href='{output_file}' target='_blank'>Open visualization in new tab</a>"))
```

Additionally, you'll need to make a small change to the `add_personality_to_graph()` function to ensure the weight is stored correctly:

```python name=modified_add_personality_function.py
def add_personality_to_graph(graph, text, persons=None):
    """Add personality traits to person entities in the graph"""
    if persons is None:
        persons = identify_person_entities(graph)
    
    print(f"Adding personality traits for {len(persons)} identified persons...")
    
    for person in persons:
        print(f"Processing personality for: {person}")
        traits = extract_personality_traits(text, person)
        
        # Add trait information as node attributes
        for trait, value in traits.items():
            if trait != "descriptors":
                graph.nodes[person][trait] = value
        
        # Add descriptors
        graph.nodes[person]["descriptors"] = ", ".join(traits.get("descriptors", []))
        
        # Optionally add trait nodes and relationships
        for trait, value in traits.items():
            if trait != "descriptors":
                trait_node = f"{trait.capitalize()}"
                if not graph.has_node(trait_node):
                    graph.add_node(trait_node, label=trait_node)
                # Store the value as both label property and weight property for edge
                graph.add_edge(person, trait_node, label=f"has_{trait}", weight=value)
    
    return graph
```

### Key Changes Explanation:

1. **Node Dragging and Positioning:**
   - Added custom physics configuration that allows nodes to be dragged and remain in their new positions
   - Set `"dragNodes": true` in the interaction options
   - Configured physics parameters to provide a good balance between structure and flexibility

2. **Trait Score Labels:**
   - Modified the edge label generation to use the trait score as the label instead of "has_trait"
   - For personality trait relationships, the label now shows the numerical score formatted to 2 decimal places

These changes will allow you to:
1. Click and drag nodes to reposition them, and they'll stay where you place them
2. See the numerical trait scores (0-1) on the arrows connecting persons to their personality traits

You can replace the original functions with these modified versions in your notebook.

User: Please change the sample_text to read in a text file, and for the generated graph file names to be of the form textfilename_graph so that the notebook can be used easily for text other than the sample used here. Again, only show the necessary changes.

In addition, it seems like the current personality query is designed in a way such that the LLM cannot see the trait scores. Here is the result of the current test query:
Personality insight query result:
Based on the provided knowledge graph, it is not possible to determine who is the "most extroverted" person. The graph only indicates that several individuals (John Smith, Sarah Johnson, Michael Brown, Emily Chen) *possess* the trait of Extraversion, but it does not provide any quantitative or comparative measure of their level of extraversion.

From the graph construction, we know that each person must have some personality score. It should be made visible to the LLM to compare.

Copilot: # Necessary Changes for File Handling and LLM Query Enhancement

### Key Changes Explanation:

1. **File Handling Updates:**
   - Modified `build_knowledge_graph_with_personality` to extract the base filename from the input file
   - Added dynamic naming for graph files based on the input filename
   - Changed example usage to read from a file instead of using a hardcoded sample_text

2. **Enhanced Query Function:**
   - Completely redesigned `query_graph_llm` to include detailed node information including personality traits
   - Added explicit formatting of personality trait scores in the LLM prompt
   - Included edge weights in the relationship descriptions
   - Added explicit instruction to use numeric values when comparing personality traits

These changes will allow you to:
1. Process any text file and generate output files with names based on the input filename
2. Get accurate personality comparisons in LLM queries because the trait scores are now included in the prompt

To use the notebook with your own text files, simply replace the default "sample_text.txt" with your own file path.
