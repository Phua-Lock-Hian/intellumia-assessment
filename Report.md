# **Report: Knowledge Graph Construction with Personality Modeling**

## **1\. Introduction**

This report outlines my approach to solving the open-ended problem of **creating a knowledge graph (KG) with personality modeling from unstructured text**, using **LLMs** as both a research and development partner. The task required not only implementing a working pipeline but also demonstrating critical reasoning in selecting methods, tools, and design trade-offs. The final implementation leverages **LangChain with Google Gemini** as the LLM backend, building a modular, extensible pipeline for automated KG generation, enrichment, and visualization.

---

## **2\. Research Process**

### **2.1 Independent Background Review**

Before engaging any LLM, I spent about 30 minutes reviewing online materials to refresh my understanding of knowledge graphs and assess feasible implementation pathways. This initial exploration revealed that **LangChain** provides an abstraction layer for LLM-based graph construction (e.g., `LLMGraphTransformer` and `GraphCypherQAChain`). I also noted that my prior experience with the **Gemini API** could be directly applied through `langchain-google-genai`.

### **2.2 Brainstorming with Perplexity**

I used **Perplexity AI** to systematically identify solution approaches (full conversation in *Perplexity Chat.md*). Perplexity generated three possible strategies:

1. **Manual Knowledge Graph Construction** — human-curated nodes and edges.  
    → *Discarded* as it did not meet the problem’s requirement for automation.

2. **LangChain-based Automated Extraction** — using Gemini as the LLM to extract triples (subject, relation, object) and construct graphs programmatically.  
    → *Selected approach.*

3. **Training a Custom LLM** for entity and relationship extraction.  
    → *Rejected* due to the 8-hour project constraint.

Perplexity’s analysis aligned with my prior intuition, validating that a **LangChain–Gemini stack** offered the best balance of feasibility, scalability, and code modularity. It also provided conceptual clarity on the use of **`LLMGraphTransformer`**, **Big Five personality traits modeling**, and **visualization via PyVis or Neo4j**.

## **3\. Implementation Development**

### **3.1 Code Generation with Copilot (Claude Sonnet 3.7 Thinking)**

Implementation was developed interactively with **Claude (Copilot)** (*see Copilot Chat.txt*). The iterative workflow followed a structured pipeline, progressively refined through short prompt–response exchanges to maintain LLM accuracy. Copilot was selected for code generation due to its strong reliability in producing syntactically correct Python notebooks.

#### **Initial Version**

The initial notebook, *KnowledgeGraph\_with\_Personality.ipynb*, was scaffolded with the following modules:

1. **Environment Setup** — installation of dependencies (`langchain`, `langchain-google-genai`, `networkx`, `pyvis`, etc.) and initialization of Gemini via LangChain.

2. **Text Preprocessing** — using `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` to chunk text for token-efficient processing.

3. **Graph Extraction** — employing `LLMGraphTransformer` to obtain triples.

4. **Graph Construction** — building a directed graph in NetworkX.

5. **Personality Modeling** — extracting Big Five traits for person entities via Gemini prompts and adding them as weighted edges.

6. **Visualization** — rendering an interactive graph using PyVis.

7. **Querying** — enabling natural language queries via Gemini (`query_graph_llm`).

#### **Key Modifications**

Through testing and debugging, several critical refinements were made:

* **Bug Fixes:**

  * Removed deprecated `.verbose` and `.triples` attributes.

* **Usability Enhancements:**

  * Modified visualization to disable physics (`"enabled": false`) for readability and manual repositioning.

  * Replaced trait edge labels (`has_openness`, etc.) with **numerical scores** for clarity.

* **Dynamic File Support:**

  * Allowed loading of arbitrary text files instead of static sample text.

  * Automatically generated output filenames (`{textfilename}_graph.html`) for easier reusability.

* **Enhanced Query Context:**

  * Revised query prompts to expose **trait values directly to Gemini**, ensuring personality-based comparisons could be reasoned about quantitatively (e.g., “Who is most extroverted?”).

These refinements were applied across the modified functions in *Copilot Chat.txt*, namely:

* `visualize_graph()`

* `add_personality_to_graph()`

* `build_knowledge_graph_with_personality()`

* `query_graph_llm()`

## **4\. Output and Results**

### **4.1 Generated Graph**

The final graph output (*knowledge\_graph.html*) visualizes entity–relationship structures and personality connections for the input text — a synthetic passage describing employees at a company (“TechInnovate”).

* **Red nodes:** People (with personality data)

* **Blue nodes:** Organizations or locations

* **Green nodes:** Big Five personality traits

Edges between people and traits are labeled with numeric scores (0–1), and their thickness corresponds to magnitude. For instance, *Michael Brown → Extraversion (0.90)* visually indicates a strong trait expression.

### **4.2 Personality Modeling**

Each person’s node tooltip includes:

* Trait scores for **Openness**, **Conscientiousness**, **Extraversion**, **Agreeableness**, and **Neuroticism**

* Key descriptors (e.g., “creative, organized, patient”)

This allows both human interpretation and LLM reasoning over structured trait data.

### **4.3 Visualization Example**

When opened, the graph displays nodes with free dragging enabled and stable layout (no snapping back), addressing the usability issue discovered during testing.

## **5\. Justification of Design Choices**

| Design Decision | Rationale |
| ----- | ----- |
| **LangChain \+ Gemini** | Combines structured graph transformation utilities with Gemini’s strong semantic reasoning. |
| **NetworkX \+ PyVis** | Lightweight, visual, and easily exportable without database setup (e.g., Neo4j). |
| **Big Five (OCEAN) Framework** | Universally recognized and quantifiable personality representation model. |
| **Edge Weights as Scores** | Numeric labels and thickness convey trait magnitude visually and semantically. |
| **Short Multi-LLM Workflow** | Prevents context drift and leverages model specialization (Perplexity for research, Copilot for coding, GPT for reporting). |

---

## **6\. Insights and Reflections**

* **LLM Synergy:** The multi-agent workflow demonstrated clear advantages. Perplexity’s live web grounding ensured accuracy in concept formation, Copilot’s structured code generation minimized syntax errors, and GPT’s summarization was ideal for producing this report.

* **Prompt Design:** Chained prompting was critical. Separate prompts for entity extraction, personality modeling, and visualization prevented conflation of tasks.

* **Interpretability:** Explicitly embedding numeric personality values in the graph and in LLM prompts significantly improved interpretability and query quality.

* **Limitations:**

  * Personality extraction accuracy depends on Gemini’s interpretive consistency; results may vary across runs.

  * The visualization layout can still become cluttered for large texts.

  * Evaluation metrics (precision/recall for triples) were not implemented due to limited ground truth.

  * Rate limits on Gemini API free tier restrict the amount of text that can be processed at a time. To minimize this restriction, the model with highest rate limit, Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite is used, but even then, it is insufficient to process an entire Wikipedia article.

---

## **7\. Future Enhancements**

* **Schema Normalization:** Introduce named entity resolution (NER) or Wikidata alignment.

* **GraphRAG Integration:** Combine KG with vector retrieval for hybrid question answering.

* **Quantitative Evaluation:** Measure entity-relationship extraction accuracy using benchmark datasets.

* **Domain Adaptation:** Train domain-specific personality extraction prompts for greater reliability.

## **8\. Conclusion**

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end pipeline for constructing and enriching knowledge graphs from unstructured text using **LangChain and Gemini**. The approach integrates natural-language understanding, personality modeling, and interactive visualization within a modular architecture.

The workflow satisfies the assessment’s requirements by:

1. Conducting **independent LLM-assisted research** (Perplexity).

2. Developing a **working LangChain–Gemini implementation** (Copilot).

3. Providing a **structured report generated by an LLM** (GPT).

The final solution not only achieves automated knowledge graph creation but also illustrates how reasoning-capable LLMs can be systematically orchestrated across research, development, and reporting phases to produce coherent, explainable outputs.
